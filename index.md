# About Me

I am <b>Ruchir Ravishankar</b>. I am recent graduate with my MS (Master's of Science) in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Cincinnati. My interests lie in CFD, Numerical Methods, Heat Transfer, Gas Turbine Combustion. My research at UC involved investigating the effects of key-variables in training Physics Informed Neural Networks in Machine Learning for CFD (RANS and LES/DNS data). I am currently working on understanding analytical vortices formulations - Lamb and Burgers vortices; and how their creation led to a deeper understanding of turbulence modeling.

I am seeking full-time entry-level/early-career roles in the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering domains. I am also open to internships, keen to leverage my skills from academia in the industry.

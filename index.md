# About Me

I am <b>Ruchir Ravishankar</b>. I am recent graduate with my MS (Master's of Science) in <u>Aerospace Engineering</u> from the University of Cincinnati. My interests lie in CFD, Numerical Methods, Heat Transfer, Gas Turbine Combustion. My research at UC involved investigating the effects of key-variables in Physics Informed Neural Networks in Machine Learning for CFD (RANS and LES/DNS data). I am currently working on understanding analytical vortices formulations - Lamb and Burgers; and how their creation led to the understanding of turbulence modeling.

I am seeking entry-level/early-career roles that are full time, in the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering domains. Please reach out to me at my[email](mailto:ravishankarruchir@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](./_config.yaml/linkedin)

Here is my [Resume](./assets/files/RuchirRavishankar_resume.pdf). Any feedback is appreciated.
